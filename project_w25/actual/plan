As of right now, the plan is:

The Python will:

1. Scrape the data using a python file
2. Store labor data in a CSV file.
3. Make the python file run and refresh so that labor data is live feed

The HTML will:

1. Use Javascript to read the CSV and pass it so the UI page
2. Loop the Javascript so that it displays the most recent CSV data
