    <p>I am currently studying both accounting and classes related to computer science.</p>    
    <p>I'm trying to decide which of these fields I'd like to pursue, or ideally how I could blend the fields together (and make a good amount of money doing so). I am originally from Knoxville, TN and recently returned from a mission in Anaheim, CA.</p>    
    <p>I hope that no matter what career path I choose tha this class will allow me to have web design knowhow so I can create my own business eventually and be able to do things such as make a website for it.</p>
